# Web scraping use cases
# Overview

The main subject of this repository is web scraping. In a nutshell, four web scrapers were developed with Python as use cases to portray different web data extraction scenarios:
1. [HTML tag-based extraction](#1-html-tag-based-extraction)
2. [JSON var-based extraction](#2-json-var-based-extraction)
3. [JSON API-response-based extraction](#3-json-api-response-based-extraction)

## 1. HTML tag-based extraction
