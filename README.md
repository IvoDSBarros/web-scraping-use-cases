	website "en.wikipedia.org": multiple wikipedia tables on the highest grossing concert tours of all time 
2: JSON var based extraction;
	website "www.rollingstone.com": list of the 500 greatest albums of all time
3: JSON API-response based extraction.
	website "api.nytimes.com": to extract data of all hardcover fiction/nonfiction books for all the best sellers lists of the New York Times
