# Web scraping use cases
# Overview

The main subject of this repository is web scraping. In a nutshell, four web scrapers were developed with Python as use cases to portray different web data extraction scenarios:
+ 1. HTML tag-based extraction;
+ 2. JSON var based extraction;
+ 3. JSON API-response based extraction.

## 1. HTML tag-based extraction
+ website "thegreatestbooks.org": list of the greatest books of all time (n=300)
+	website "en.wikipedia.org": multiple wikipedia tables on the highest grossing concert tours of all time
